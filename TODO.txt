for shallow search, consider overlap in win paths - if multiple win paths of 2 share a square, then it's a trap!

add alpha-beta to minimax

for minimax, need a fast but reasonable heuristic for boards besides just wins
  - longest run
  - favorability (as used in shallow approach) (slow)
  - ?






OLD:

sometimes you can block by moving to get in someone's way, but not necessarily in one of their win paths
- actually, it sort of half does this - but need to make sure it includes these in candidates

log every game it plays

search deeper on less certain branches of tree

include diversity in power score (number of unique positions in wins. ==> lots of ways to win? or bottleneck?

consider how in control you are
- how many options does the opponent have
